# About Me
Hello, I'm __Thomas__. I am originally from __Buenos Aires, Argentina__ but I grew up in __Austin, Texas__. Last year I took __Comm Lab__ and __Interaction Lab__ and really enjoyed them so I'm really looking forward to taking this class this year. I have a bit of experience in __Processing__ and thus my favorite thing to do in code is play with __p5__. I'm a big fan of drawing with code. I really appreciate making websites look intentionally shitty and early 2000's, I just love that aesthetic.

In my free time, I enjoy using __Ableton__ to make hip-hop beats for people to rap on. This is my passion and I hope to be able to one day use code to develop my own __VSTs and Extensions__ for Ableton to create my own unique synths and sounds.

I am a project oriented student and that is one of the main reasons I love the IMA program here. I've had nothing but amazing experiences in IMA so I'm really excited for this semester!
